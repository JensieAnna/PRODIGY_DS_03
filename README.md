This project focuses on building a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. Utilizing the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which includes a variety of features such as age, job, marital status, education, and past marketing campaign outcomes, we aim to develop a predictive model that identifies potential customers.
